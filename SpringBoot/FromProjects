Q1. What is annotation @Controller?
Ans. It tells the Spring framework that the annotated class is designed to handle web requests and interact with the model and view components 
and mapping them to specific handler methods to return either a view.

Q2. What is @RequestMapping annotation used for?
Ans. The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map web requests to specific handler classes and/or handler methods within a Spring application. 
@RequestMapping can be applied at both the class level and the method level.

Class Level: When applied to a controller class, it defines a base URI for all endpoints within that controller. 
All method-level mappings within that class will then be relative to this base URI.

Method Level: When applied to individual methods, it defines the specific URI for that particular endpoint, which can either be absolute or relative to a class-level @RequestMapping.

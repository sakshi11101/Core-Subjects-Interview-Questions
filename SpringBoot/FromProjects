Q1. What is annotation @Controller?
Ans. It tells the Spring framework that the annotated class is designed to handle web requests and interact with the model and view components 
and mapping them to specific handler methods to return a view.

Q2. What is @RequestMapping annotation used for?
Ans. The @RequestMapping annotation is used to map web requests to specific handler classes and/or handler methods within a Spring application. 
@RequestMapping can be applied at both the class level and the method level.

Class Level: When applied to a controller class, it defines a base URI for all endpoints within that controller. 
All method-level mappings within that class will then be relative to this base URI.

Method Level: When applied to individual methods, it defines the specific URI for that particular endpoint, 
which can either be absolute or relative to a class-level @RequestMapping.

Q3. What is Lombok?
Ans. Lombok is a Java library used to reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating common methods like getters, setters, toString(), 
and equals() at compile time through annotations.

Q4. What is @Data annotation for?
Ans. This annotation is provided by java library, and automatically generates common methods like toString(), getters and setters, reducing
some boilerplate code.

Q5. What is @NoArgsConstructor for?
Ans. It automatically generates no-args constructor for a class.

Q6. What is @AllArgsConstructor for?
Ans. @AllArgsConstructor annotation generates a constructor initializing all object fields.

Q7. What is @RequiredArgsConstructor for?
Ans. @RequiredArgsConstructor generates a constructor that initializes only fields marked as final or @NonNull.

Q8. What is @Service annotation for?
Ans. @Service annotation in spring boot is a specialisation of @Component annotation, that designates a class belongs to service layer.
This layer is responsible for encapsulating all the business logic and performing operation which might include accessing the data
from data access layer etc.

Q9. What is @Component annotation for?
Ans @Component annotation in spring boot is a class level annotation that marks the java class as spring managed component. 
This indicates to the Spring container that it should be automatically detected during classpath scanning and registered as a Spring bean.

Q10. What is @Repository annotation for?
Ans. @Repository annotation is a specialisation of @Component annotation in spring boot, that indicates that class is a repository. 
This layer is responsible for data persistence and data retrieval, effectively acting as (DAO) data-access-object layer that interacts with
database or other data storage mechanisms.

Q11. What is @Autowired annotation for?
Ans. @Autowired annotation in spring boot is the core mechanism to achieve dependency injection. 
It instructs spring IoC(Inversion of control) container to automatically resolve and inject beans(dependencies) into your application's 
objects. This eliminates the need for manual configuration and object creation, leading to more modular and testable code.

------- How Autowired Works? -------
When spring container initializes your application, it identifies the classes marked with @Component, @Controller, @Service, @Repository
as spring beans. When a bean requires another bean as a dependency, we can use @Autowired to tell spring to provide that dependency
automatically.
